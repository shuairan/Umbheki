"""
Defines the basic interfaces for a plugin. These interfaces are
inherited by the *core* class of a plugin. The *core* class of a
plugin is then the one that will be notified the
activation/deactivation of a plugin via the ``activate/deactivate``
methods.

For simple (near trivial) plugin systems, one can directly use the
following interfaces.

When designing a non-trivial plugin system, one should create new
plugin interfaces that inherit the following interfaces.
